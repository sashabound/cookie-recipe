# Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe

A simple webpage built with HTML as part of my web development learning journey.

## What I Practiced
- Basic HTML structure (head, body, headings, paragraphs)
- Creating unordered and ordered lists
- Adding images with the <img> tag and alt text
- Writing clean, readable markup
